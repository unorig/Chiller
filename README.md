# Chiller (Commodore64) source code
This is the decompiled source code for Chiller for the Commodore 64. 

## Description
I am very slowly working my way through the code for Chiller for the Commodore 64 and commenting all the code. The ultimate goal is to released an updated version that lowers the difficulty level and makes it a little more playable.

Considering improvements such as:
* Lowering the health damage (Especially when jumping)
* Better jump control while in the air

## The code

The dis65 files are from 6502 Bench (https://6502bench.com/) which I highly recommend if you are doing any 6502 disassembly.<br>
The S files are the Assembly output from 6502 Bench which will assemble using 64Tass (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/).
